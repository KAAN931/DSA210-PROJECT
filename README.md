# DSA210-PROJECT
Project Proposal:
The motivation for this project is to apply data science methods to a real-world problem in planetary defense. Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) can pose a potential collision threat, and this project aims to build a model to identify them.

Goal: To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether an asteroid is "Potentially Hazardous" (a PHA) based on its available orbital and physical data.

Research Question: What are the most significant features (minimum orbit intersection distance, eccentricity, diameter) that determine if an asteroid is classified as hazardous?

The Data to be Used:
The project will use a single, publicly available dataset: the Asteroid Dataset available on Kaggle.

This dataset is a single, compiled CSV file sourced from the NASA JPL Small-Body Database (SBDB). It contains orbital parameters (like eccentricity, semi-major axis, minimum orbit intersection distance) and physical parameters (like diameter and albedo) for thousands of asteroids.

Plans on How to Collect It:
The data collection process is straightforward:

Navigate to the Kaggle dataset page for the Asteroid Dataset.

Download the asteroid_dataset.csv file directly.
